The other player also tries to hit your ships by calling out coordinates.  Neither you nor the other player can see the other's board so you must try to guess where they are.

You record the miss F6 by placing a white peg on the lower part of your board at F6. Your opponent records the miss by placing. When all of the squares that one your ships occupies have been hit, the ship will be sunk. You should announce \\\"hit and sunk\\\".
