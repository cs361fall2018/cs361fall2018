The Battleships game will be a much more interesting game to play. Create a new wiki page on your team's repo called “Sprint 3 User Story”, and make sure that your user story adheres to the format:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Card: (“As a [user], I want [function], so that [value]”)</li>\\n<li>Conversation: (Details that clarify the user story) </li>\\n<li>Confirmation: (Tests to show when the User Story is completed)</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>Your user stories will be evaluated on whether they follow <a href=\\\"https://xp123.com/articles/invest-in-good-stories-and-smart-tasks/\\\">INVEST</a>.</p>\\n<ol start=\\\"3\\\">\\n<li>\\n<p>From the user stories, each team will create a series of features that need to be implemented in the code. These will be added to the Github issue tracking system. Each of these must be assigned to a specific team member, as well as have a time estimate given in the body of the issue. The issues will be tagged with <code>feature</code>. Also, make sure that each issue is linked to the appropriate user story.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Create a new milestone, called <code>Sprint 3</code>, with the deadline being the assignment due date.

Also, if your master branch does not pass the CI tests, now it's time to fix it. This implementation process should still be organized into tasks and documented in the GitHub Issue Tracker, as well as adhering to the GitHub Flow.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Refactor to Object-Oriented Design. Using code smells, identify places in your code that require refactoring. Using OO principles such as Inheritance, Polymorphism a-d Encapsulation, refactor the Battlehip codebase (including the new features, if applicable), making sure your design respects the SOLID design principles.

Using the user stories as a guide, along with the newly refactored Object-Oriented code, implement the new features.
