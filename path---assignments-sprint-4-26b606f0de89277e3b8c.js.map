Market research has shown that users become bored with the regular Battleship game after 2-3 weeks of use and are not using the game after that. In order to keep those users engaged the marketing department wants to add an additional features to the Batthleship game. They would like to add a new type of ship, the <em>submarine,</em> a new type of weapon, the <em>space laser,</em> and the ability to move the fleet around the board. Details for each feature is detailed below:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>A new type of ship will be introduced: the submarine. A submarine can be placed on the surface or it can be submerged, and thus be placed on the grid under any other type of surface ship. It takes up five blocks on the grid, as follows:</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><img src=\\\"/images/submarine.png\\\"></p>\\n<p>The submarine's captains quarters is indicated in red, and it is armored.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>A new type of weapon is introduced: “the space laser.” It is fired from a network of geostationary satellites, and unlike the conventional bombs that we have until now, they penetrate the water, being able to hit both a surface ship, and a sub that is placed below it at the same time (i.e. in contrast the bomb can only hit the surface). The player receives the activation codes for the space laser only after sinking the first enemy ship (i.e. this weapon is an upgrade, and replaces the conventional bomb in the player’s arsenal). In the future we might add new types of weapons.</li>\\n<li>A player can now move his fleet. When the command to move is given, each ship will move one position. The player can specify the direction of the move (N, S, E, W). North is towards the top of the board (like a map). If a ship is already at the edge, it will not move (i.e. ships cannot \\\"fall\\\" over the egde). Ships cannot overlap during the move. The player can only move their fleet twice, after successfully sinking two enemy ships. This move will not be reflected on the opponents display (The hits don't move once the opponent moves the fleet).</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h1>Learning Objectives</h1>\\n<p>This assignment will help you learn the following:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Work with a team to design and implement changes to your model and view</li>\\n<li>Conduct code reviews within a team in order to verify functionality, prevent conflicts, and increase quality</li>\\n<li>Use a testing framework to validate functionality and prevent errors</li>\\n<li>Divide tasks among team members</li>\\n<li>Use GitHub Issue Tracking, Pull Requests, and Branches correctly</li>\\n<li>Use UML to describe the current state of your application, as well as propose changes to it</li>\\n<li>Refactor your code to accomodate new architecture changes</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h1>Tasks</h1>\\n<p>To complete this assignment, each group needs to do the following:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>Team Repository.</strong> You will continue working on the same codebase you worked on during Sprint 3.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>Create User Stories for New Features.</strong> From the Introduction section, as well as the design document, turn the new features into user stories and add them to a new wiki page on your team's GitHub repo.
